1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
heels

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Disaster

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, half an hour left, and I'm going to grab something to drink.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Emilio.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How are you, Mrs. Marisa?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Very good.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey, the TV's starting to look bad. Why don't you go up to see what's going on with the antenna?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, I'm going up now, beautiful.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're not going to the party, Natalia.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, I won't talk to you.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But this girl can hear me.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Help me with the bags.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going, I'm going.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Good afternoon.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Emilio!

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The elevator doesn't work!

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, it does. The door is open.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
ValentÃ­n, no. Here, no.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Again, you always see the dog and the door.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, I'm not leaving.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Emilio, clean that up.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey, the ads in the buckets.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Come on.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Jose Miguel, don't play with the ball.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The bags, the bags.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Tomorrow at eight, the counters will come.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I get in at nine.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You'll have to get up earlier.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And you clean your feet.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's wrong with you, Polimpia?

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You should have studied.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You could have closed the door.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For one thing you have to do.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, you, the street in the Philippines.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know, buy yourself a map.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What the fuck.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey, this doesn't go up.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What do you mean it works?

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's no one alive here.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here, here, here, there's no one alive.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here, no, here, no.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Every day is like this.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I couldn't imagine it when I came here.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was just looking for something to eat.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I wake up every day in the middle of a hurricane.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Here, here, here, there's no one alive.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here, no, here, no.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here, here, here, there's no one alive.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Here, no, here, no.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The house under me collapses.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't find the doorman.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The neighbors watch me and listen.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't stand it in this place.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They put me in a cocktail bar.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A earthquake and a volcano.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And behind this staircase.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Here, here, here, there's no one alive.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here, no, here, no.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Here, here, here, there's no one alive.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Here, no, here, no.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here, here, here, there's no one alive.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Alicia, dinner's ready.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sorry?

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I made panache with vegetables and chicken.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can make you a tortilla.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, I'm excited. It's the first time I see this table.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Is the tablecloth ours?

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, I bought it this morning.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey, don't you have a brother around?

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes, but he's married.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Here comes the man of the house.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Shut up, I can't move.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You and the manager?

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I've got a bullet in my back.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's going to be a lumbar.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't worry.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Lie down, I'm going to make you a hot water bag.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to call a friend of mine.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't worry.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And this?

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Nuria made it.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't tell me.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's perfect.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She won't have a brother for me.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, she's the only daughter.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm so scared.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why don't you tell me when you're coming?

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Try this, please.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We'll have dinner together, but why don't we stay at a restaurant?

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tell Dad to shut up.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's getting cold. Don't tell me you're deaf.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's so heavy to see the floor.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a normal and ordinary apartment.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's not a normal and ordinary apartment.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't talk about our apartment like that.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, we'll stay here.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But on Saturday.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, we'll stay on Saturday.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then take a taxi.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why should I go to the hotel?

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mom, a taxi.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, don't be fooled.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's for Japanese.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Kiss.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're having a good time with your parents, aren't you?

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, I'll hide my pictures and watch the movie.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mauri.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't worry.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll tell him.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That we're a couple.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come on, I'm gay.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you going to tell him?

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I'll do whatever you want.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mauri.

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes?

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The neighbor is watching us.

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's get separated naturally.

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's up, Tronco?

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How are you, ma'am?

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Here, learning mathematics.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nice.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Come on, Concha.

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's cross the zebra crossing so that the cars get screwed.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I'll stay.

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't you see my face?

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, the usual one.

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And the night that the upper ones have given me.

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Entering and leaving until five in the morning and, on top of that, going up men.

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Women will be friends?

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or customers.

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Clients? What do you mean?

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That are whores.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You'll tell me.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We don't know what they work in.

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They enter and leave until the morning.

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They dress as they dress.

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And, on top of that, they do nothing but go up men.

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How do you like to think, Valdez?

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Good morning.

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good morning.

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This one came yesterday.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He's been here a while and he's leaving.

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Relax, woman, it's going to hurt more.

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You think in the field.

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In the field.

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let me know, let me know.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, okay, that's it.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're better now from back pain.

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes, I have a sore ass that from the lumbar I can't even walk.

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What a pity.

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What a beast.

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm coming.

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, then tomorrow at the same time, right?

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Couldn't it be a little later?

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've been with my wife to take the kids to the movies.

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I see.

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You've made me dust today.

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Come on, don't exaggerate.

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Tomorrow at eight o'clock I'm here, okay?

165
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come on.

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
See you later.

167
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Goodbye.

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
See you later, good afternoon.

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Good afternoon.

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Good afternoon.

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Look at this.

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Look how happy he is.

173
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And he's married.

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's why he's coming.

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
These two have turned my house into a prostitute.

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, they've done a work.

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I should ask them for a percentage because I love you, madam.

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to see the president right now.

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are they?

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The top two girls?

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm the president of the community and I didn't know anything.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And what do you want?

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Put a sign next to the phone as if they were dentists.

185
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But Juan, you won't believe anything.

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're the one who's got the girls and you want to throw them out.

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to call the police.

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, no, leave the police.

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's clear that this is a decent building and we're not going to allow unhealthy activities.

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But we don't have any proof.

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
None.

192
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What happens is that you are three bored, the only thing you know how to do is get into people's lives.

193
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like you.

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, you're insulting me, Juan.

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, the only thing I ask you to do is to be discreet and not to comment on it.

196
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's get to know each other.

197
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Dani, uncle, you're going to freak out.

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The two neighbors upstairs are two whores.

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, leave the phone.

200
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Leave the phone.

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, calm down.

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, calm down.

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're punished.

204
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're punished.

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Calm down.

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Roberto.

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Roberto, it's me, Nuria.

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Nuria, but hey, what are you doing here?

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I just moved here in front of you.

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Come on, what a coincidence.

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, it's not a coincidence.

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hey, how about you?

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How about you?

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are you still with that girl you left me with?

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's her name?

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
LucÃ­a.

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's it, LucÃ­a.

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You live here, right?

220
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It seems that things are getting serious, right?

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, man, we've been together for three years.

222
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Look, you've been with me for three years too.

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Do you remember that last week going out with the two of us at the same time?

224
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That if LucÃ­a, that if Nuria, that if LucÃ­a and we went out without knowing anything.

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But what a cool guy, huh?

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because I'm sure she still doesn't know, right?

227
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, I'm leaving, come on.

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I had a son.

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh yeah?

230
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Congratulations.

231
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You and me.

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Boy, I wanted to tell you, but since you didn't pick up the phone, look.

233
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
His name is Nacho.

234
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
From the Mexican restaurant where you left me.

235
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Damn.

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, it's a shame we don't cut it in Chinese, if not...

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
His name would be Chop Suey.

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But hey, I'm sure...

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No, silly, he's my nephew.

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, how good, Nuria.

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hey, let's go down the stairs to see if my blood circulates.

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Come on, come on, we'll see each other, huh?

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, and a lot.

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because you still don't know it, but you still love me.

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't worry, huh?

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to open your eyes.

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Bye.

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
These ladies are crazy.

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now they've been given by these poor girls up here.

250
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
To know what they'll talk about us.

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sure they'll see us, they're very stupid.

252
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, I'm not saying you're right, Paloma.

253
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But it's a very serious matter.

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
An alternate house here in the building, well, no.

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Of course, what I don't understand is how there are men who go with these professionals having their wives in their houses.

256
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Me neither, darling.

257
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh no, darling, no.

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Juan, I'm tired, you always wait until the last minute.

259
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, it's true, you're right, I haven't set the time, I'm sorry.

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You already know that my good time is the snack.

261
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There, whatever you want, whatever you want, my love.

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Where are you going?

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
To the bathroom.

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
To what?

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
To wash my teeth.

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't be late.

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

268
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You see, give me the casting address.

269
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

270
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hey, what's that? Another ad?

271
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What I want is to make a series, not to advertise ham cooked.

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hello, good morning.

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And how much do they pay?

274
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Only 400 euros?

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, they always say the same thing, but then things get long and...

276
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But no.

277
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What about the client?

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes, I've done something with that.

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Shut up.

280
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, how am I dressed?

281
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, very good, bye.

282
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Good job.

283
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, that's great.

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
See you later.

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Bye.

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Juan.

287
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Juan.

288
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Juan!

289
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What?

290
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We have to talk.

291
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Who was talking to?

292
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
With his boyfriend?

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, Miguel, for God's sake, what a vocabulary.

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What a mouth this child has, hey.

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Like his father's, because his mother doesn't get out.

296
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But who likes your parents, Fernando?

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Because I could put your faces, but if they are a little old...

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No, they are not old, put whatever you want.

299
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's that if I make rice and they are not punctual, it happens to me that we are fatal.

300
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
By the way, when are you going to tell him? Because it can give me a headache.

301
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know, Mauri, I haven't thought about it.

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, think about it, because if you tell him in the middle of dinner and he gets angry, then look, I don't do it anymore.

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Leave the subject of dinner with my parents, please.

304
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If they come, what's wrong with you?

305
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can't breathe.

306
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What do you mean you can't breathe? Don't scare me, Fernando.

307
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Emilio!

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What's wrong?

309
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That you can't breathe.

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really, you call me for everything, huh?

311
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let me, let me for a moment.

312
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You are very white, you look like a capper, right?

313
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But you are soaked today and your pulse is going to a thousand.

314
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh my God, it's going away.

315
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Emilio, please call an ambulance.

316
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No, no, don't worry, I think it's over.

317
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But what do you say?

318
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I am very apprehensive, I can't see blood.

319
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But if there is no blood.

320
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes, but if I fall, yes.

321
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm better now.

322
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Really, huh?

323
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't know what happened to me.

324
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What happened to me?

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't worry, don't worry.

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go get it.

327
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

328
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Nothing happened.

329
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay.

330
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Come on.

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Since nothing has happened, it's been a while that the two bastards have made me pass this.

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I've been in bed for a while to see if this happens to me a little.

333
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh my God.

334
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The bastards.

335
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't turn him around anymore.

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It has been an anxiety attack.

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, but lately I have a lot of work.

338
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No, it's not because of that.

339
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's because of dinner with your parents.

340
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Fernando, you are not prepared to tell him.

341
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I want you to leave the closet, but I live.

342
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, you'll tell him later.

343
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If I don't tell him, we have a problem.

344
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, but I can handle it, and that's it.

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I told them that I live with my girlfriend.

346
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes, we have a problem.

347
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But why?

348
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Leave it.

349
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Who are you going to tell him to?

350
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Forget it, forget it.

351
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, tell them that he has had to go on a trip.

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's it.

353
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No.

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No, if it is that he has already gone on a trip.

355
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And he has made communion with his niece.

356
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And his sister has married.

357
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And he has done the elprosuction.

358
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
His grandfather has died.

359
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And it is that no more things can happen to him.

360
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He looks like the protagonist of a snake.

361
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, then what do I do?

362
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I put on a wig and some heels.

363
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Maybe without heels.

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is the typical moment that would strangle you.

365
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But if I'm doing yoga, it's supposed to be for something.

366
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hey, I say.

367
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
At a given moment.

368
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
At a given moment.

369
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh yes, I can say it.

370
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, yes.

371
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
As the thing that ...

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This girl, Alicia, the neighbor.

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If we ask her for a favor.

374
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Maybe I could make her go through my girlfriend.

375
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes, but it's just the time my parents are.

376
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How do you see it?

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Very well.

378
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
A moment ago you were going to introduce your parents to your homosexual boyfriend.

379
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And now it turns out that the homosexual of my boyfriend has a girlfriend because he has told his parents that he is heterosexual.

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Precious.

381
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But only for a while.

382
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And what do I do that little while?

383
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I go to jail with the rabbit.

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You were not going to go to the movies?

385
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Besides, you haven't asked Alicia yet.

386
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Maybe she doesn't want to.

387
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Or she can't.

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Of course, I loved it.

389
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But why do you have to tell your parents that you have a girlfriend?

390
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Well, because it gets very heavy.

391
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You know, if I'm very old, if the grandchildren, that I get angry.

392
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Alicia, I've invited you.

393
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well then, what time tomorrow?

394
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, I don't know, at nine.

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay?

396
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

397
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hey, how do I look dressed?

398
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, I don't know, so you can get an idea.

399
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You work at the buffet.

400
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm a waitress.

401
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, lawyer.

402
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And put on something elegant and a little classic.

403
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You don't have that.

404
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't worry, I can leave you whatever you want.

405
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Get on, get on.

406
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The first one has been up for a while.

407
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But they are not gay.

408
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And I don't know if this is a shame.

409
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's true, here the only ones who don't wet are us.

410
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hey, thank you very much.

411
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You don't know how well this comes to me.

412
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're welcome, man, we're scared.

413
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
See you tomorrow.

414
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
See you tomorrow.

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Good morning.

416
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Good morning.

417
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Good morning.

418
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's not long, is it?

419
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The normal.

420
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He's going to introduce me to his parents.

421
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He's going to introduce you to his parents because he doesn't dare to tell them he's gay.

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But why are you so envious?

423
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That this guy is gay?

424
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What's up?

425
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He's gay and he'll be gay forever.

426
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know what's wrong with that, that the one who goes, doesn't come back.

427
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's true.

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hey.

429
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hi, honey.

430
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hi.

431
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is Nuria, the new neighbor in front.

432
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hi.

433
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Nice to meet you.

434
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I was telling Lucia that you have a beautiful house.

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Green is my favorite color.

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Look.

437
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey, weren't we going to the movies?

438
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes.

439
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you want to come with us?

440
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
No, no, I only have two tickets.

441
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Don't worry, we're going to see each other a lot.

442
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You envy me.

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's been a long time since I've had a boyfriend.

444
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I think we're going to come back, because we were a very good couple.

446
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If he's left it, it's because of something, isn't it?

447
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Or not, people make mistakes and maybe he's sorry.

448
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Maybe yes or maybe no, we don't know.

449
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is talking for talking, if it's not going to ...

450
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He's dating someone else now, but I don't think he's happy.

451
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Sure, I'm sure he still loves you.

452
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, I don't see it that way.

453
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're giving advice without knowing.

454
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Love ends and it ends.

455
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, it doesn't end, Roberto.

456
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, if you think you have a solution, you go for it.

457
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I see that as a burden.

458
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And we're going to be late for the movies.

459
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Come on.

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Well, couple, I'll leave you.

461
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Come on.

462
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, you calm down.

463
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You'll see how everything is fixed.

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And you know, if you want anything, ask me for it.

465
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll tell you the same thing, I love sharing.

466
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
See you later.

467
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Sorry.

468
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
See you later.

469
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, that's good, right?

470
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
At least we have nice neighbors in front of us.

471
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Lucia, you get into anyone's house.

472
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The least thought of day we're going to have a taste.

473
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's see, what have you talked about?

474
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, I don't know, a little bit of everything.

475
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Can you tell me what's wrong with you?

476
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, no, no, that people are so nice to me, it gives me a bad feeling.

477
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Look, look at the clown from McDonald's.

478
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I think you're getting paranoid here with the whole neighborhood.

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, I'm going to get my shoes and if you want we go to the movies.

480
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes.

481
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm going to go to the movies.

482
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Did I have a reason or did I not have a reason?

483
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes, madam, you were right.

484
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But hey, have you all gone crazy?

485
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Are you really serious?

486
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey, because you haven't heard what Juan and I have heard.

487
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Without cutting, huh? And in front of the child.

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
400 euros they charge for service.

489
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Fuck, that's what I would charge for pension.

490
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And what I put on the PlayStation when you play.

491
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This neighborhood is getting lost.

492
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Armando, we have to get on all together.

493
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why? Do you make group discounts? Sure.

494
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, no, man, not to talk to them.

495
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But let's see what you have done to make them do what they want.

496
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You're getting hooked, like you're making money.

497
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Juan.

498
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
By the way, can you show me all this you're saying?

499
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This afternoon at eight, BelÃ©n has a client.

500
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But who are you? The secretary?

501
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, they have a client, so what?

502
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If the only place from where you could see something is from the floor of the new ones.

503
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They are not.

504
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They are not and they are minus ten.

505
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We are going to get lost.

506
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hey, Emilio did not have a key to this floor?

507
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Emilio.

508
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Emilio. Yes.

509
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What are you doing?

510
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I was trying to remember a phone number, but it does not come to me.

511
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We need the key to the third floor.

512
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
For what? For the ...

513
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Because yes.

514
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But Mr. Cuesta, I can not do this.

515
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I, as the doorman of this farm, have a responsibility with all the neighbors.

516
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When a neighbor gives me his key, for me that is sacred.

517
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We want the girls in the third floor to see that they are prostitutes.

518
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Upstairs.

519
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Wait, wait a moment.

520
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And if I go back to the new ones?

521
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And if someone stays watching?

522
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Very good idea. Stay.

523
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No, then I can not lose it.

524
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, you can stand.

525
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Come on, bring the keys here, man, and let's go upstairs.

526
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Come on.

527
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you see Roberto and Lucia reappear, call me ... call me ...

528
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But how am I going to call you if this is your phone?

529
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
No, my wife's.

530
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So this is your wife's phone?

531
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
No, this is mine and you call me this other.

532
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If you see them reappear, you give the one and the yes, the green.

533
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So one yes and green.

534
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No, yes and green is the same.

535
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then when?

536
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The yes, they will come before they know.

537
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Hello, good afternoon.

538
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hello.

539
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, get up, get up.

540
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Hello.

541
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hello.

542
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hello.

543
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You charge 400 euros and receive a chandelier.

544
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's that the chandelier thing now takes a lot.

545
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Damn, how nice they have left this. Menta mandarin.

546
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's a good idea.

547
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So I painted the gate.

548
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey, turn off the light.

549
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And take that yesterday I did not pay you.

550
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Take two.

551
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wait, let's see if I have the change.

552
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's see.

553
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No, this, this, this.

554
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This and this.

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Come on.

556
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well nothing, with love.

557
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Calm down.

558
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Life, life, life, what are we doing here?

559
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Tell me.

560
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
No, Juan is not, I am a neighbor.

561
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's that he left me his phone.

562
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Who is calling me?

563
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Your mother?

564
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hello.

565
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Do you like this sun?

566
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No, no, no, no.

567
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What a joy, madam.

568
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We thought you had died.

569
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
How you were delicate there.

570
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's been a long time since we saw you around here.

571
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, madam, I have to hang up.

572
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
One, Jesse Verde.

573
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Introduce pin.

574
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Pin.

575
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Pin.

576
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Mr. Cuesta.

577
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Pin.

578
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, another 400 euros.

579
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
These girls in three months they put on a Marbella vest.

580
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
400 euros, charge BelÃ©n.

581
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes.

582
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
How the prices have been put, eh, chipote with the euro.

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, what do you want me to tell you?

584
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I see it very clearly.

585
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well, maybe he is a friend and he owed him money.

586
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's see, this is a decent building and I will not allow moral perversion and the collapse of the house.

587
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
One of the values that with so much effort we inculcate our children.

588
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Okay.

589
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Now, having said this, I must add that we do not have any conclusive evidence.

590
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I think that perhaps some of us, if it were to be done by client, could prove it.

591
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You do not eh, Juan.

592
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You do not.

593
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Go put together, surely he is used to these things.

594
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
My son does not go to those places.

595
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Well, someone has to go.

596
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If I have to make the effort, I make the effort.

597
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But this pays me for the community.

598
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And above we will fall into a stream.

599
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Happy birthday, happy birthday, I wish you a happy birthday.

600
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Happy birthday of whom?

601
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Can you know what all these people do in my house?

602
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Eh?

603
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yes, tell me.

604
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They are going up, they are going up.

605
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
If it is Vicenta, tell her that it is no longer necessary that the cake is uploaded.

606
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
No, no, we already have a good party here.

607
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Natalia, I'm going to throw the garbage and look at the photos.

608
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What are you telling me?

609
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Tell the mother that she is in the bathroom.

610
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I do not talk to her.

611
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Well, write her a note.

612
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Now I come.

613
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Another one that goes up.

614
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Mom, separate the mirilla that the brand is going to leave you.

615
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Of course, and how are you going to throw them if it is also a client?

616
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Juan too.

617
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Come on, the president seemed silly to me.

618
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Normal, married to that.

619
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Of course.

620
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Hello.

621
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Hello, are you busy?

622
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No, I was watching the TV.

623
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is a bit violent, but could you give me a few minutes?

624
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes, yes, of course, come in, come in.

625
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
What's wrong with you? Are you feeling bad?

626
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
No, nothing, a bad posture.

627
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Ah, what do I do?

628
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I sit down?

629
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes, of course, sit down.

630
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Why? I'm not used to these things.

631
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, I actually just want to talk.

632
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Talk?

633
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No, it's that I have a problem in bed with my wife.

634
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ah, well, it's ...

635
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You have a lot of experience in men.

636
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, Alicia, I'm more theoretical.

637
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What is the best posture for the woman to reach orgasm?

638
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, look, good question.

639
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I think it's a matter of trying.

640
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You recommend me to change.

641
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yes, but come on, I think this is all with whom, with the time.

642
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You have to talk to your wife, right?

643
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
With Paloma? No, I don't prefer to talk to you.

644
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Ah.

645
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hey, and the point G?

646
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What's wrong with him?

647
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
No, where is it? Because there is no way.

648
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Well, I think it's in the head.

649
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Of course, that's why he goes to the hairdresser so much.

650
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
No, man, no, it's psychological.

651
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's that I've read that men also have it.

652
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Well, yes, but you wouldn't like it where?

653
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Well, I have to go. I'm very comfortable, but I don't want Paloma to suspect anything.

654
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Well, it's been very interesting.

655
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's true what they say about you, you know how to listen to a man.

656
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But, but ...

657
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Please, because I can't afford it anymore, you've won it.

658
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
What? It's been a pleasure.

659
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Thanks.

660
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Uh. Hello.

661
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Good night. Good night.

662
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Goodbye. Bye.

663
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And here the president of the community.

664
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Well, he has come, he has told me that he had problems in bed with his wife, he has given me 100 euros and he has not left the bag in the garbage.

665
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
How do you interpret it?

666
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Well, I don't know, it's a bit weird, right?

667
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes.

668
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't know.

669
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Hey.

670
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Damn, Nuria, but how did you get in here?

671
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Are your keys in the door?

672
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey, please leave right now. Lucia can come at any time.

673
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't think she'll come.

674
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What have you done to her?

675
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Nothing. But Lucia won't be back in an hour.

676
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Hey, don't put it here.

677
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Let's see, what do you want me to do?

678
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Ask for forgiveness?

679
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Come on, okay, I ask for forgiveness.

680
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No, give me a kiss.

681
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Come on, man, give me a kiss and we forget everything.

682
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Come on.

683
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's it.

684
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
No, not enough.

685
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Hey, come on, this is not funny, go.

686
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh no? Well, I'm scared.

687
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh, by the way, you don't know what I've done.

688
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What?

689
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I've put some of my clothes in Lucia's drawer.

690
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm sure you'll recognize her right away.

691
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The question is, will you recognize her?

692
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh no.

693
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
This one sounds good to me, this one too.

694
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I gave this one to her.

695
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
This one doesn't sound good to me.

696
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This one doesn't sound good to me either.

697
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It has a lot of clothes, but why does it have so many?

698
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Hello.

699
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hey, what's up?

700
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What are you doing?

701
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Well, ordering the drawers, Lucia, they're very messy.

702
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
When you live with someone, you have to respect a series of rules, you know?

703
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Damn, we don't have an assistant.

704
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay, okay, okay, thank you very much.

705
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Well, when you finish ordering mine, order yours.

706
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes, of course, yes, yes.

707
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's not fixed.

708
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's not fixed.

709
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Of the many things that come to mind in this situation, the one that comes to mind the most, but from afar, yes.

710
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I prepared dinner and your girlfriend is the one who covers for Gloria.

711
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, if you want we can go back in time.

712
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Come on, go back in time.

713
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
No, no, it's a mess.

714
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
My parents will be on their way.

715
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I can't with your world, Fernando, I can't.

716
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's eight o'clock.

717
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think it's a good time.

718
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
For what?

719
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well, for you to go preparing to go to the movies, right?

720
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
No, I stay in the room, reading.

721
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
When my mother wants to see the bedroom, I tell her what you are.

722
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
A stuffed animal.

723
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
If the cats are not allergic, tell her you have stress.

724
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't leave you here alone with the one above, not even a little bit.

725
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But what happens?

726
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Don't you trust me?

727
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Not you, and less of her.

728
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Look, the girlfriend.

729
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Don't get too close to her, she's doing us a favor.

730
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm close, but if she hears the perfect ad, I'll lower the trailer.

731
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Same.

732
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

733
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Ali Macbeth, the lawyer.

734
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
How are you?

735
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Fuck, you are very good.

736
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I brought you some pictures for the living room.

737
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And then I brought you this little one for your wallet.

738
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Then if you want you can keep it.

739
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I also brought clothes for your wardrobe.

740
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Here, the shoes to be at home.

741
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Some notes for the fridge.

742
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
A box of tampons for the bathroom.

743
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And some passions and official magazine.

744
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Very professional.

745
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I like to prepare myself.

746
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Listen, we met three years ago.

747
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I was your boss and you fell in love with me.

748
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Two months later we were living together.

749
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We want to get married but we can't find a place.

750
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We want to have two children, Ariadna and Gael.

751
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And we like yoga a lot.

752
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Formenting in the documentary of whales, what do you think?

753
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Good.

754
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What are your parents' names?

755
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Enrique and Monse.

756
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hey, we should kiss sometime, right?

757
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What was that?

758
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Felix. The cat.

759
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Ah, we have a cat.

760
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Three.

761
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh, how cute, I put it on the table.

762
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Do you want me to help you find a movie?

763
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No, thank you very much.

764
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Hello.

765
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Hi.

766
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Hi.

767
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What? Did you find my balls?

768
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yes, I found them and threw them away.

769
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Really?

770
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, it has a lot of merit because I didn't put any.

771
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What are you looking at?

772
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Hey, is there any chance, even if it's small, that you leave me alone once?

773
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes, lie down with me.

774
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay.

775
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And any easier?

776
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes, I can also tell Lucia that you were going out with both at the same time and see how she feels.

777
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Hey, don't do that to me, please, I'm very in love.

778
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I was also very in love three years ago.

779
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Look, you have 24 hours to decide.

780
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Here you have my number.

781
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Bye.

782
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Bye.

783
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
What do you mean, bye? And is the movie taking?

784
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It can take whatever you want. Have you seen how it is?

785
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yes, like a goat.

786
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So maybe I have a chance.

787
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Well, you're going to make a good couple, look.

788
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Where are you going? The 21 is here.

789
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Excuse me, the floor of Fernando and his girlfriend?

790
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Fernando and his girlfriend, how good, the first B.

791
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Thank you.

792
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
See you later.

793
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Damn, it's late, I'm going to fix it.

794
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Honey, your parents.

795
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Honey, your parents.

796
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Pagasus.

797
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hello, mom.

798
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Son.

799
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And, have you gotten fat?

800
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Fuck, what it has cost us in the movie, we have to go to the cinema.

801
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And, have you gotten fat?

802
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Fuck, what it has cost us in the movie, we have to go to the cinema.

803
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Hey, and in the portal there is a junkie?

804
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No, it's the doorman.

805
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Son, what a neighborhood.

806
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Well, I'm going to introduce you to Lorena, my girlfriend.

807
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Hello.

808
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Very pretty.

809
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Thank you very much.

810
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Nice to meet you.

811
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Likewise.

812
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Do you want to drink something?

813
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Me, a white wine and my husband a Jerez.

814
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Well.

815
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Hey, but what color have you painted this?

816
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This is gray.

817
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I like it, the living room is wide.

818
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And the kitchen?

819
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This is the kitchen.

820
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Ah, very modern, so everything together.

821
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And that?

822
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's a singer, mom.

823
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Ah, of course, Camilo Sexto.

824
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Fernando, love, where have you left the glasses?

825
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You have them in front of you, my life.

826
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, what have you prepared for dinner?

827
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Dinner?

828
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What is there for dinner?

829
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, this is a puree like potato.

830
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And this is another meat with sauce.

831
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
BichissuÃ¡ and duck's blood with tangerine and mango.

832
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Useless.

833
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
BichissuÃ¡ and duck's blood with tangerine and mango.

834
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That.

835
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's very modest.

836
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
How long will this one take? What will he be doing?

837
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Today.

838
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Today.

839
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Today.

840
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Today.

841
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Today.

842
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Today.

843
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Today.

844
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Today.

845
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Today.

846
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Today.

847
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Today.

848
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Today.

849
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Today.

850
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Today.

851
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Today.

852
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Today.

853
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
How beautiful, what a diva.

854
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Very handsome, Emilio.

855
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Now you will fulfill.

856
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But I like this uniform more.

857
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Here, Emilio, 400 euros from the funds reserved for the community.

858
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Melio, tell him not to do a invoice, we almost saved ourselves the same.

859
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Hey, and you, do something to see if they give us a discount for being neighbors.

860
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Wait a minute, but the money does not have to be spent.

861
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
No, because when he offers it to the girls and they accept, we can throw them away.

862
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But if Emilio does not have to do anything.

863
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
No, Mrs. Paloma, things are either done well or not done.

864
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
There must be conclusive evidence.

865
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
If you do not get to wear the dress, who believes it is Monica Lewinsky's?

866
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's right.

867
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Come on, and now all up.

868
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Emilio, you first, gentleman, please.

869
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Come on, yes, yes, yes, yes.

870
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Come on, yes, yes, yes.

871
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
There goes that macho, that macho.

872
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Come on, come on.

873
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Look, Lucia, this is what there is.

874
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I went out with the two of them for a week.

875
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And what? I did not tell you not to hurt yourself.

876
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
What, you do not like it?

877
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Well, you'll have to learn to live with it.

878
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
What do you want me to tell you?

879
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It kills me, it kills me, son.

880
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I can not tell you or fuck.

881
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Hello, honey.

882
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Lucia. What?

883
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The neighbor is crazy.

884
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Which of them? Because we have to choose.

885
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Nuria, the one in front is like a fucking goat.

886
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
She is harassing me.

887
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Look, Roberto, as soon as a woman looks at you,

888
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
you think she wants to sleep with you.

889
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
No, no, no, no, she is obsessed.

890
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
She has moved here for me.

891
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Honey, I love you very much.

892
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But you are not Brad Pitt.

893
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
No, of course not.

894
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I am Michael Douglas and Jean-Claude Claus in Fatal Attraction.

895
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You know what I'm telling you? Have you seen it?

896
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The thing with the knives.

897
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yes.

898
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But she was saying out there that she was my girlfriend.

899
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Roberto, look, you spend many hours at home drawing.

900
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And maybe the smell of the markers is crazy.

901
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't you believe me?

902
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Well, no.

903
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Okay, I'm going to call her.

904
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You'll see how she presents herself right now.

905
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You don't know this bitch.

906
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Fuck, I'm nervous.

907
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Let the time that doesn't ...

908
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Hello.

909
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
What are you wearing?

910
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Sorry, is Alicia there?

911
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Well, no, she was not down first.

912
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Do a favor to Fernando.

913
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Well, then I'll be back for another moment.

914
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm here.

915
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What do you want, Emilio?

916
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Can I stop by for a while and chat a little?

917
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Another?

918
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, what's wrong with you all?

919
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Well, we are alone, BelÃ©n.

920
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Come on, come on.

921
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But for a while, huh?

922
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm very busy.

923
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Of course, of course.

924
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's just that people are no longer for movies.

925
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Well, what do we do?

926
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Well, I don't know, Emilio.

927
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You will tell me.

928
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, I don't know, get me a beer or something.

929
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
To get me loose a little.

930
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Are you also going to give me 100 euros?

931
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I have 200 euros.

932
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
For you.

933
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I don't understand anything.

934
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But I'm going to get drunk.

935
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This is also good, damn it.

936
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes.

937
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But this is delicious, Lorena.

938
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Well, my hand is a little bit dirty with the salt.

939
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Be careful if you give me your hand too.

940
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
How about in Mallorca?

941
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Very good.

942
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Let's see when you come to see us.

943
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
When you want, we are delighted.

944
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
What's wrong with those cats?

945
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
There is an oncelo.

946
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, Lorena, what case are you in now?

947
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Fernando told me that you have specialized in ecological crimes.

948
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's just that my father is also a lawyer.

949
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Ah, how good.

950
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Ecological crimes.

951
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Well, it's a case that is very curious.

952
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Because it comes from a zookeeper who was cleaning in the nutrient tank.

953
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And he slipped and fell.

954
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
With such bad luck that he put his foot in the panda bear cage.

955
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And he bit him.

956
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
He tore his three fingers, come on, he ate them.

957
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But pandas don't eat bamboo.

958
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yes, yes, but he wore bamboo on his shoe.

959
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And he also gave himself a nail polish to separate the wounds from the nails.

960
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And the panda bear got intoxicated and died.

961
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So the caretaker ate the nails of the feet.

962
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's just that he had previously been a contortionist in the Cirque du Soleil.

963
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But hey, the case is that since the panda bear is a protected species,

964
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
the zoo has sued the caretaker.

965
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And the caretaker has sued the nail polish brand

966
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
for not putting it on the prospect, which is lethal for panda bears.

967
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's a very complicated case.

968
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Have you read it in the newspaper?

969
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
No.

970
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Well, I'm going to get dessert.

971
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Fernando, he's a great lawyer.

972
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
He doesn't understand anything at all.

973
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'll drink that beer from that kid,

974
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
otherwise I'll have to go to hell.

975
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What are you doing?

976
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You're degenerate.

977
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You're going to pay me for 200 euros.

978
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
What am I going to do to you?

979
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
What have you believed?

980
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What is this?

981
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Fernando, what have you believed?

982
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What kind of treatment is this for a client?

983
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
What client?

984
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Get out of here!

985
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You're calling me a whore, Emilio.

986
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm not a whore.

987
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
What am I going to do?

988
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Get out of my house!

989
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You're not whores.

990
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What do you mean?

991
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Emilio, please, shut up.

992
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I've already called the police.

993
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
What have you done?

994
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
What do you want us to do?

995
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Nothing happens.

996
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm going to call the police.

997
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's here.

998
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Hide and listen.

999
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Wait.

1000
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Take this just in case.

1001
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Don't you think you're exaggerating?

1002
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
No, this is a movie.

1003
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yes, you're right.

1004
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Hello, you called me, right?

1005
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yes, come in.

1006
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yes, we're going to do it.

1007
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What?

1008
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What do you mean?

1009
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Take off your clothes.

1010
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Roberto, it's not funny.

1011
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You have a girlfriend.

1012
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Don't play hard to get with me.

1013
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Get out of my pants.

1014
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What's wrong?

1015
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You have problems with Lucia?

1016
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
No, I have problems with you.

1017
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You're scaring me.

1018
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'd better go.

1019
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Give me a kiss right now.

1020
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I don't want to.

1021
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Give me a kiss right now.

1022
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You're not going to kiss me.

1023
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Leave me alone.

1024
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I don't know.

1025
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
She's been moving for a month.

1026
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm not crazy.

1027
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
She's the only crazy one here.

1028
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What?

1029
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
We've been dating for three years.

1030
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You're lying.

1031
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What do you mean?

1032
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I was dating both of them and I decided to marry her.

1033
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Well, it wasn't so hard to tell your girlfriend.

1034
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm sorry, Lucia, but I was so bad when she left me.

1035
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I had to get revenge.

1036
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Be happy.

1037
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Don't worry.

1038
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm going to my house tomorrow.

1039
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I have a beautiful duplex in the centre.

1040
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Bye.

1041
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm not telling you.

1042
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
No, no.

1043
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You're not mad, are you?

1044
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
No, not at all.

1045
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Do you want to go to the knife?

1046
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You gave him 200 euros.

1047
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We're all going to see it at the same time.

1048
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We're all going to see it at the same time.

1049
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Don't tell anyone we didn't find out.

1050
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Can you be more polite to the agent?

1051
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
For example, who's this person?

1052
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Me? The porter.

1053
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Is he usually going naked in the building?

1054
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
No.

1055
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Juan Cuesta, the mayor of the community.

1056
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I can explain everything in two words.

1057
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
No, don't get me wrong.

1058
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
These people who don't have a life of their own,

1059
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
they make up for it.

1060
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And they've been told that my flatmate and I are prostitutes.

1061
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But you have proof of that.

1062
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Do you want to file a complaint?

1063
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Of course.

1064
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
A complaint doesn't come from the court.

1065
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Please, come with me to the police station.

1066
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It was a mistake, sir.

1067
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
We know it because this lady told us.

1068
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There were men going up and down.

1069
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
These two are two gulfs.

1070
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm telling you, I'm your housekeeper.

1071
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Can you show me the rent contract?

1072
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What contract? We haven't been hired yet.

1073
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Let's see.

1074
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You come with us too.

1075
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
We'll file a complaint.

1076
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You're arresting me?

1077
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Of course, mom. Why are you calling them?

1078
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
We're getting things out of Kiccio.

1079
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
This is just a misunderstanding.

1080
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You shut up.

1081
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yesterday you came to my house and offered me 100 euros.

1082
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You too, Mr. Cuesta.

1083
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What is this girl saying?

1084
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I swear I never had the slightest physical contact with her.

1085
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
That's what Clinton said.

1086
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm about to cry.

1087
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Get in the car.

1088
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Don't tell the kids anything.

1089
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
This is a regrettable mistake.

1090
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
My husband?

1091
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We should have brought the van.

1092
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
My husband is coming to dinner.

1093
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I don't know, ma'am.

1094
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'll make him something cold.

1095
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Juan, calm down.

1096
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Calm down, woman.

1097
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Juan!

1098
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You'll be here tomorrow, woman.

1099
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You'll be here tomorrow.

1100
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's our fault.

1101
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You can't blame anyone without evidence.

1102
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
What do you mean?

1103
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
That happens every day at the conference and nothing ever happens.

1104
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That's true.

1105
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What am I going to do tonight? I can't sleep without my husband.

1106
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You can sleep with me at the door, Mrs. Paloma.

1107
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
How can I sleep with you at the door?

1108
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
My husband will kill me.

1109
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Fernando, this girl is perfect.

1110
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
She's pretty, smart and smart.

1111
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
She has a good job and she likes you.

1112
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
She doesn't lack anything.

1113
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yes, a penis.

1114
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm delighted.

1115
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We have to come more often.

1116
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Of course, for the wedding.

1117
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You're getting married?

1118
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But, son, why didn't you tell me anything?

1119
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Because we wanted it to be a surprise.

1120
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
What a joy.

1121
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Because I don't disapprove of this situation, but...

1122
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yes, she disapproves.

1123
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
She has given me a lot of travel.

1124
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But it's much nicer to be married.

1125
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Where are you going to stop?

1126
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Excuse me for a moment. I'll be right back.

1127
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Hey, if you want, I can look for my dress.

1128
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Maybe it's worth it.

1129
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Because I had more or less your body.

1130
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Oh, yeah?

1131
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yes.

1132
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
How are you?

1133
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Bad. I don't know what I'm doing here.

1134
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I look like a stressor.

1135
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Don't worry, everything is going very well.

1136
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
My parents are delighted.

1137
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And only your parents.

1138
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Come on, give me a kiss.

1139
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Excuse me.

1140
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Damn it.

1141
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Aren't you going to the bathroom, Enrique?

1142
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
No, no, no. I'm waiting for the hotel.

1143
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Are you okay?

1144
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Regular. Regular.

1145
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I don't usually pee, you know?

1146
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Do you want to take a nap?

1147
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
No. No, no.

1148
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Well, look, we better go.

1149
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Do you want me to call you?

1150
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
No, no. We better go for a walk.

1151
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I told you I was wearing heels.

1152
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Dad, are you sure you're okay?

1153
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yes, I'm fine.

1154
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's been a wedding.

1155
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Your father's nerves are going to his stomach.

1156
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Well, we'll see you later.

1157
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's been a pleasure, daughter.

1158
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Enrique, wait for me.

1159
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What a pity, right?

1160
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
With how well we were having fun.

1161
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Well, I don't know why you had to lie to me.

1162
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because I thought you were going to take it badly.

1163
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't know, you're dating someone else at the beginning of our relationship.

1164
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I had a boyfriend when I met you.

1165
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Really?

1166
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Well, yes. It's normal not to be clear at first, right?

1167
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It was also very difficult for me to decide.

1168
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
How much?

1169
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You two are very different.

1170
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
How much?

1171
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Well, I don't know, a month.

1172
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
A month? Mine was a week.

1173
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Who was it?

1174
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What are you talking about? You don't know him.

1175
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Well, if you don't know him.

1176
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
No, it wouldn't be Carlos.

1177
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Oh, well, if you know him.

1178
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
How do you know him?

1179
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But why didn't you tell me?

1180
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
A draw.

1181
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Well, it's my fault.

1182
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I should have told him directly.

1183
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Let's see how I explain this now.

1184
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Calm down Fernando, look at the positive side.

1185
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Which one?

1186
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I don't know, I'm looking for it.

1187
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Mauri, my mother can give you something when she finds out about this.

1188
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Call your father and tell him to tell him on the plane.

1189
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So the poor woman can get oxygen.

1190
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Thanks.

1191
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But... Hello.

1192
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Fernando, your father.

1193
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Dad.

1194
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Can I come in for a moment?

1195
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yes, I have to go shopping.

1196
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Stay, stay.

1197
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I wanted to talk to you.

1198
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You're gay, right?

1199
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yes.

1200
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Me too.

1201
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And me?

1202
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But dad...

1203
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I've been attracted to men for years.

1204
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But I'm married and I have a family.

1205
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But I want you to know that I support you and I understand you.

1206
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Well...

1207
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
One moment.

1208
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And mom knows something about this?

1209
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Are you crazy or what?

1210
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And now how do I explain it? Because come on.

1211
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's your problem, don't mess with me.

1212
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm going to run away because I'm going to miss the plane.

1213
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And if you go for Palma,

1214
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you know that I act on Thursdays at 11 and 1 in the Cabaret Las Vegas.

1215
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
My name is Delito.

1216
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Bye.

1217
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I don't introduce you to my parents.

1218
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
They're going to look like a lot of shit.

1219
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Delito?

1220
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You're a man of your word, Delito.

1221
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Paco!

1222
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Pacito!

1223
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Look!

1224
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Look at this dog I bought.

1225
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
How much did it cost?

1226
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
400 euros.

1227
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's a nice job.

1228
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It's cool that you like it.

1229
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But you have meat to carry this.

1230
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But if you don't need meat, close that and get on the plane.

1231
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Come on.

1232
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Nobody is going to get in.

1233
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You have 125 horsepower per cubic meter.

1234
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Come on, let's go.
