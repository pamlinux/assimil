1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

2
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,719
What do you want?

3
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,240
Vicenta, have you seen how this remote control is?

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,679
It's in the living room.

5
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,759
No, honey, it's full of bites.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm teaching Valentina to be a traitor.

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,079
Honey, when you learn, it's no longer working.

8
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,960
What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,600
Come on, I don't want to go, it's a trip of jewelry.

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,200
Hey, I bought the ticket, it cost me 6 euros.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
Well, look, it's on sale at the bus door.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,560
It's going to be full of bites.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I don't want to walk 200 kilometers

14
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,200
so I can be released in the field like Geiza and Vicenta.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
It's going to be fun. There's going to be a cape.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
A cape?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,319
These delinquents don't know what to do to get rid of the old ones.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,920
What's this idiot going to do? How are you going to come?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,240
Come on, well, I'm going, but shut up.

20
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,000
And tell this dog not to follow me.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,079
And don't follow me, Valentin, it's fine.

22
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,039
Ma'am, all I'm telling you is that I don't need the rope.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,519
I need it.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,280
You have a dryer, I see it from here.

25
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,759
If you don't see it...

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:53,939
Are you calling me a

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm going to go.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm going to go.

29
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,719
I'm going to go.

30
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,799
I'm going to go.

31
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,879
I'm going to go.

32
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,959
I'm going to go.

33
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,039
I'm going to go.

34
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,119
I'm going to go.

35
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,199
I'm going to go.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
I'm going to go.

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,359
I'm going to go.

38
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,439
I'm going to go.

39
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,519
I'm going to go.

40
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,599
I'm going to go.

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm going to go.

42
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,759
I'm going to go.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm going to go.

44
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,919
I'm going to go.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to go.

46
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,079
I'm going to go.

47
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,159
I'm going to go.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
I'm going to go.

49
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,319
I'm going to go.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm going to go.

51
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,479
I'm going to go.

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm going to go.

53
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,639
I'm going to go.

54
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,119
Yes, Emilio.

55
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,199
Don't worry about me.

56
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,359
This portal is mine and I control it.

57
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,639
If I say everybody can clean their feet,

58
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,399
they're clean and that's it.

59
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,479
How are you?

60
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,559
How are you?

61
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,159
Did you do anything to him?

62
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,399
He's a smart guy.

63
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,919
He's very good.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,239
Don't look at him, he's useless.

65
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
I like that guy.

66
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,719
He's got something.

67
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,919
He's a boyfriend and lives with him.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah?

69
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,479
Every time you see a handsome guy he's gay.

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Sadly, yeah.

71
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,639
Come on, come on in.

72
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,839
I'm going up the stairs, it's good for the ass.

73
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,239
Wait, I'm coming with you.

74
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,679
Now you leave the elevator door open,

75
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,679
so you don't have to fix it.

76
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,599
Oh...

77
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,719
WHISTLING

78
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,079
Hello.

79
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,439
Hello.

80
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,479
What, renting a movie?

81
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,159
No, I'm taking time off

82
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,359
to get home late and annoy my father.

83
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,079
Oh, very well.

84
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,479
How's your girlfriend?

85
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,039
What?

86
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,279
My girlfriend?

87
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,039
Good, very good.

88
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:40,679
I don't see you mature enough to maintain a stable relationship.

89
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,359
Oh, no? No.

90
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,079
If you commit, you'll regret it.

91
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,719
But it'll be too late.

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,039
You'll have wasted the best years of your life

93
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,239
and you'll be the typical family father,

94
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,759
trapped in the routine.

95
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,599
How sad, right?

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll tell you.

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,799
Lulu's age.

98
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,439
What?

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,519
Lulu, no.

100
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,399
I'm here with the hive.

101
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,079
I'm leaving, it's 1.20.

102
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,479
We'll keep talking, right?

103
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,439
How's the president's daughter?

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,399
Hey, I have a girlfriend.

105
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,479
Me too.

106
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,039
Hello.

107
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,759
Well, honey, is the egg ready?

108
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,240
She's thinking about it.

109
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,560
No, I've already chosen.

110
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,959
Of course.

111
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,759
Well, I'll wait for you at home.

112
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,719
Of course, this one's also very good.

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,279
Yeah, but she has a boyfriend.

114
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:37,719
And me?

115
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,639
Here, here, here, no one lives,

116
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,159
here no, here no.

117
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,839
Every day is like this,

118
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,360
I couldn't imagine it when I came here,

119
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,719
I was just looking for something to eat.

120
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,960
Every day is like this, I couldn't imagine it when I came here,

121
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,400
I was just looking for something to eat.

122
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,600
Here, here, here, no one lives,

123
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,480
here no, here no.

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Every day is like this, I couldn't imagine it when I came here,

125
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,240
I was just looking for something to eat.

126
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,480
The house on the start of Rumba,

127
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,760
I can't find the doorman,

128
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,920
the neighbors watch and listen to me,

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,640
I can't stand it in this place,

130
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
they put me in a glass,

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,519
where do we enter this staircase?

132
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,360
Here, here, here, no one lives,

133
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,839
here no, here no.

134
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:32,920
Here, here, here, no one lives,

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
here no, here no.

136
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,399
Here, here, here, no one lives,

137
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,120
here no.

138
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
education

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:54,680
and

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,220
myself

141
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,840
good

142
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,839
Don't worry, I'll paint it later.

143
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,839
Benito, the radiator is down there.

144
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,839
And put the plastics on.

145
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,839
Where are you going to start?

146
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,839
First, that wall outside.

147
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,839
We take off the paint, paint that wall, lift the floor and get into the kitchen.

148
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,839
How long will it take?

149
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,839
Faster than fast.

150
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,839
I like it that way.

151
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,839
Antonio, look, sorry, he's Roberto.

152
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,839
Come on, boy, in ten days you'll be home.

153
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,839
Can we talk for a moment?

154
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,839
Hey, Antonio, don't forget about the moldings.

155
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,839
Yes, yes, you're asked.

156
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,839
What is this?

157
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,839
Antonio, the captain.

158
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,839
What are these people doing here? What's going on?

159
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,839
Reform?

160
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,839
Reform.

161
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,839
But don't you remember I told you?

162
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,839
They are from my father's construction, they have made a hole for us.

163
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,839
You know how lucky we are.

164
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,839
Are you sure we've talked about this?

165
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,839
Sure, you never listen to me when I talk to you.

166
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,839
Well, I'm leaving.

167
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,839
Anything you need, ask Roberto.

168
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,839
Wait, I'll go with you.

169
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,839
I have to go to the warehouse for a material.

170
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,839
I'll leave you with that, I'll hit you.

171
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,839
Well, honey, goodbye.

172
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,839
Okay, then I'll call you, you'll tell me.

173
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,839
Good luck.

174
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,839
Well, do you know what you have to do?

175
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,839
Yes, yes, yes.

176
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,839
Okay, until what time are you going to be more or less?

177
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,839
Yes, yes, yes.

178
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,839
You speak Spanish, right?

179
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,839
Yes, yes, yes.

180
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,839
This is going to be fun.

181
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,839
Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,839
Come on, honey, breakfast, we're getting late.

183
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,839
Natalia, we're leaving.

184
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,839
And dad, get out of the bathroom.

185
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,839
I'm going.

186
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,839
But, honey, take those kids away, you're going to school.

187
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,839
You, we're not going.

188
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,839
We're not going.

189
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,839
What childhood are you giving me, among all?

190
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,839
Shut up, shut up.

191
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,839
Are you listening?

192
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,839
Those are works.

193
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,839
Juan, Juan, works, works.

194
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,839
Yes, yes, I'm listening, they're the new ones.

195
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,839
These guys up there have started throwing tabics.

196
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,839
Well, they haven't warned me.

197
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,839
Neither have I, what a shame.

198
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,839
When you do your homework, you don't warn anyone either.

199
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,839
Of course, because I'm the president.

200
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,839
I'm going to talk to them right now.

201
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,839
Take the papers, honey.

202
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,839
I can't, Juan, because I have an appointment with the gynecologist.

203
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,839
Juan.

204
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,839
No, no, there's no hurry, I have an exam.

205
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,839
And me?

206
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,839
Come on, don't eat anymore.

207
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,839
Is it over?

208
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,839
Mom, you're scratching me.

209
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,839
I'm going to scratch you, well scratched.

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,839
How are you, Natalia, please help me.

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,839
Lucia.

212
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,839
Lucia, listen to me.

213
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:41,839
Lucia.

214
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,839
Look, this is the third message I leave you, call me.

215
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,839
I think the guys have brought this, your parents are doing what they want.

216
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:49,839
A kiss.

217
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,839
But hey, what is this?

218
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
According to article 17 of the horizontal property law, paragraph 5,

219
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,840
the works must be notified to the president of the community at least a week before the start.

220
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
I am the president of the community and I knew nothing.

221
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
I didn't know, I live here, you'll see.

222
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Well, at least you'll have a permit to work at the city hall, right?

223
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Green paper, the copy.

224
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

225
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Oh, yes, yes, yes, what?

226
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
We don't have it.

227
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
The one who has it is in my girlfriend's house and is working and doesn't answer the phone.

228
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Well, you have to stop the work until this is cleared.

229
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Come on, stop working.

230
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Not kick-ass.

231
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Stop working.

232
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Hey, hey.

233
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Nothing, nothing, don't bother, if they don't speak Spanish.

234
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Pick, pick-stop.

235
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
No picking.

236
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Nothing, but if I have tried, they don't speak English either.

237
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Hey, I'm telling you, don't kick-ass.

238
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Well, you have to speak languages.

239
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Hey.

240
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
It's over.

241
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Finished.

242
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Now to house.

243
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Holidays.

244
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Holidays.

245
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Ok?

246
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Come on.

247
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Go, go.

248
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Go.

249
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Do you see how they understand me?

250
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
That's how you miss the pronunciation, I'm sure.

251
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
What a mess.

252
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Pum-ta-ta-pum-ta-pum-ta-ta.

253
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Here there is no one alive, Ole.

254
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Man, the angels of Charlie.

255
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
How was the tour?

256
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Very well.

257
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,840
They have taken us on a bus, they have taken us on a trip, they have given us a little bite and they have tried to sell us an express pot.

258
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Beautiful day.

259
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Beautiful, beautiful.

260
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Have you watched the two gulfs up there?

261
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
I haven't seen them all day today, Mrs. Concha.

262
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm going to see what they're doing.

263
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Very well.

264
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
You should have seen Toreando in the capea.

265
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
It's a good thing I took the vaquilla off her, tell me right away, or she'll kill her.

266
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Come on.

267
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
It's just been a stir.

268
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Come on.

269
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Oh, come on, hurry up.

270
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
As if we had something to do.

271
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Come on, you three are going pretty, with the cap.

272
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Oh, mother, what a day I have, my God, what a tiredness.

273
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I have a desire to take off my shoes.

274
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Tonight I'm going to put on some heels.

275
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Vicenta, I opened the door for you.

276
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
I do not.

277
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
What do you mean you do not?

278
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
If you do not, I leave the door open.

279
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Thieves have entered.

280
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Oh, my God, they've entered our house.

281
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
But what happened?

282
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
They have forced us to the door, look.

283
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Oh, what gentleness is loose.

284
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,840
God, I said there were no excursions here, there were no excursions here.

285
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Well, go guard dog.

286
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
But how are you?

287
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
How are you?

288
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Commercial, computer, carpenter, commercial.

289
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
What are you doing looking for work?

290
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,840
No, I'm looking at the shelves, let's see if my ex appears.

291
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
How's the casting?

292
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
I have not been caught.

293
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
But I have found Fernando again on the portal.

294
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Oh, very nice.

295
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,840
We did not arrive at the end of the month and you thinking about the neighbor.

296
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Oh, I'm confused.

297
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
It's the first time that a guy I like does not listen to me.

298
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
You end up getting used to it.

299
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I'll have to take the initiative.

300
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
What a good love.

301
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Look, Ali, I tell you because I'm your friend.

302
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
You're going to get a lot of trouble.

303
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Let's go.

304
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Where are we going?

305
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,840
I have come up with a super original idea to talk to Fernando.

306
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Which?

307
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Hello.

308
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Hello.

309
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Do you have salt?

310
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Yes, of course, a moment.

311
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
It's super original.

312
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Alicia is pathetic, come on.

313
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Whatever you want, but it works.

314
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
You'll see how to get a girl.

315
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Take it.

316
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,840
And be careful with the salt, which retains a lot of liquids.

317
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Thank you.

318
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
You're welcome.

319
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
It works.

320
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,840
What I have not been very clear is what time you have been.

321
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Well, yes, they have forced the door.

322
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I do not know why, but they have forced the door.

323
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Well, at least they have not taken anything.

324
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
I think they have seen Valentí and he was scared.

325
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
That must be.

326
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
And you have not seen anyone strange?

327
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
No, apart from you, no.

328
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
That's what they wanted, if we have nothing.

329
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Well, you have been lucky not to be at home, that if you arrive to be,

330
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
the same violates that kill you both.

331
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,840
I do not know how you can live quietly in a first.

332
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,840
The day less thought, they enter through the window and if not, in time.

333
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I live in a second and also my son is.

334
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
If not, it's been a long time since I had put an alarm.

335
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
And what does an alarm cost?

336
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Hello, honey.

337
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
How have they left this like this?

338
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Finally someone who speaks my language.

339
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
What happened? They have not done anything.

340
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
The president of the community has arrived

341
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,840
and they are standing in no matter what paragraph, no matter what article,

342
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
they have stopped the works.

343
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
What has he done?

344
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
Hello, Lucia.

345
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,840
But who do you think you are to stop me the works?

346
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I am the president of the community.

347
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,840
No, you have no right to get into my house to think about anything.

348
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
I do not know if you know that to make reforms at home

349
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
you need a permit to work in the town hall.

350
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Oh yeah? And what is that?

351
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,840
At first glance it seems a permit to work in the town hall.

352
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,840
And now what? Are you going to pay me the delay?

353
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Man, I do not think it's worth it.

354
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm going to pay you the delay.

355
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
What is that scandal? What voices are those?

356
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Nothing, Doña Concha, nothing.

357
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Oh, they are not hours.

358
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
What? And what are you looking at?

359
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Juan, do not let yourself be, do not let yourself be.

360
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Marisa, this is the house of the president of the community.

361
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I do not know what you are doing here.

362
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I am going to tell you everything.

363
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I am going to tell you everything.

364
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I am going to tell you everything.

365
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Marisa, are you asleep?

366
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Nooo.

367
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Hey, what are we going to do if they come back?

368
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Who are they?

369
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
The ones who have broken the door.

370
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
And who tells you that they are going to come back if they did not take anything?

371
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Of course, because maybe they are looking for us.

372
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Of course, they have seen us on the cover of the interview and they have been caught.

373
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm serious.

374
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Look, sleep and leave me alone.

375
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
What is that noise?

376
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Valentín, look, look, look.

377
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Today I better sleep with my teeth on, I will not have to bite someone.

378
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,840
But who can get up to work at eight in the morning apart from Iñaki Capilondo?

379
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Oh, sorry, if I say it for these, sorry, Fernando, a kiss, give me a kiss.

380
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Oh, be careful, let's see if you go down and wash my sheets.

381
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Yes, yes, yes.

382
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Oh, they have already finished with the peak.

383
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Look, look, look.

384
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Look, look, look.

385
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Sorry.

386
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Go.

387
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Hey, hey, hey.

388
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Hey, hey, hey.

389
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Hey, not there.

390
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Not there, elevator, the elevator is for people.

391
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
The bags on the stairs and without stain, come on, let's go.

392
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Look how he is putting me, but this guy is stupid.

393
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Kid.

394
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
The bag outside, damn it, stay there.

395
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
The bag outside, on the stairs, I'm telling you.

396
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Throw it on the stairs.

397
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Wait, I'm going to shit myself.

398
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Over here, damn it, throw it over here, throw it over there.

399
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
That guy is frozen, this guy, I have to take it out.

400
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
The mother fucker.

401
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

402
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

403
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Mother fucker.

404
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Mother fucker.

405
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Well, yes.

406
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Come on.

407
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
You can't come and stop the works, you can't.

408
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I've tried it, but you can't.

409
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
This is unbearable, man.

410
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
My hair is falling off because of the stress.

411
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Everything is made of churrasco.

412
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Well, I clean, but they are very fat.

413
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
But hey, they don't have to warn us.

414
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Well, nobody has come here to tell us anything.

415
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Because this lady does her job very badly.

416
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Hey, my husband does a lot, huh?

417
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Well, we'll have to see the accounts.

418
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
You can't stand it, it's seven and they're still here.

419
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
According to the law, they can be working until nine at night.

420
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
But it starts at eight and they're there all day long,

421
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
stinging.

422
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Well, it's terrible to sting for three hours.

423
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Well, a little joke to relax us.

424
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
How funny.

425
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Well, they have entered our house to steal from us because

426
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
the portal is open all day.

427
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
And everything is made of churrasco.

428
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,840
Yes, it feels nice, we've heard it before.

429
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Well, I don't know what the solution is, but something has to be done.

430
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,839
I know it's uncomfortable for everyone, for me the first one.

431
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,839
But they have promised me that they will finish right away.

432
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,839
Hey, they are very short.

433
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,839
Yes, yes, yes.

434
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,839
He doesn't speak Spanish, huh?

435
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,839
Go, president.

436
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,839
Alicia, you know that stealing cards is a crime.

437
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,839
If I'm going to return it,

438
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,839
then go down to his house and tell him that they have

439
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,839
been wrong in the field of our house.

440
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,839
It's worse than the sun, it's going over you for a moment.

441
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,839
Oh, I'm going to kill you. Get her out, get her out.

442
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,839
Come on, let's go.

443
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,839
I think this is our safe.

444
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,839
And the letter?

445
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,839
Look, my name.

446
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,839
See? That's why I didn't open the key.

447
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,839
If it's not our safe.

448
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,839
If you're clumsy, come on.

449
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,839
But what are you doing?

450
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,839
I don't know.

451
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,839
What are you going to know if you don't know anything?

452
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,839
Ladies,

453
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,839
congratulations on your choice.

454
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,839
This alarm system consists of three motion sensors,

455
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,839
located one in room two, kitchen, three, bedroom.

456
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,839
Now you have to enter a four-digit secret code

457
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,839
that under no concept should tell anyone.

458
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,839
Which one do we put?

459
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,839
The one with the credit card 4547.

460
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,839
Shut up, put the one with the money, then you tell me.

461
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,839
Look over there.

462
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,839
That's it.

463
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,839
I repeat, you must not tell anyone.

464
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,839
And now I will explain its operation.

465
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,839
It is very simple.

466
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,839
To activate the alarm system in the entire house,

467
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,839
press a secret key or secret code

468
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,839
then press the enter key on the lower right.

469
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,839
If you only unlock a specific area,

470
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,839
press the bypass key

471
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,839
kept on your left top right.

472
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,839
And the area number should be disabled.

473
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,839
One for the room, two for the kitchen, three for the bedroom.

474
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,839
Then hold the shift key,

475
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,839
located on the upper right.

476
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,839
Then for five seconds to close the red button

477
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,839
on the bottom left of the control panel.

478
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,839
Then this time only press the enter key.

479
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,839
That's it.

480
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,839
Do you understand?

481
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,079
Congratulations.

482
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,359
Are you with Fides again?

483
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,799
How come all the neighbours are going with me?

484
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,799
I don't understand.

485
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,559
What fault do I have that the upper ones start working?

486
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,159
All I'm saying is that with that attitude

487
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:47,959
you're going to put the whole neighbourhood on top of you.

488
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,279
What attitude?

489
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's see. Who's in charge here?

490
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,839
You.

491
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,839
No, in the community.

492
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,959
Ah, me.

493
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Me.

494
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Well, and you, huh?

495
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm sure that these people up here are doing something illegal.

496
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,799
Weren't they throwing a wall?

497
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,319
Yes.

498
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,319
Well, it's a load.

499
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,319
How do you know?

500
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,319
And what else does it matter how you know it or not?

501
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,319
You say it's a load.

502
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,319
Of course.

503
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,319
And then they need an architect to sign the project.

504
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,319
Well, there it is.

505
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,920
I'm convinced that she wants to change the windows.

506
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,640
And they want to close the terrace.

507
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,200
Alteration of common elements.

508
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,880
Tomorrow you go up and you look at what they're doing.

509
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Those people still haven't found out who we are.

510
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
But they will.

511
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Marisa.

512
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Marisa.

513
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
You've fallen asleep.

514
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
No, I'm watching TV.

515
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Come on, let's go to bed, we have to set the alarm.

516
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Come on, damn it.

517
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Let's see how this is.

518
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Code.

519
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Zone.

520
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Enter.

521
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,960
And now we have ten seconds to leave the living room.

522
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Come on, run to the bedroom.

523
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Come on, let's go.

524
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
But without pushing.

525
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Oh, well, all right.

526
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,039
Come on.

527
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,039
My little glass of milk.

528
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,039
Leave it, there's no time.

529
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
No, no, there's still time.

530
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,039
Otherwise I won't sleep.

531
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,039
No, run, run.

532
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,039
Yes, yes.

533
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,039
Oh.

534
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
Someone is calling.

535
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,039
You're the one who's been calling.

536
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,039
I have it, I said.

537
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,039
This is the condom.

538
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,039
They also install the drama without my permission.

539
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,119
Now, for God's sake, the phone.

540
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,119
Turn off that, you're going to be on TV.

541
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,119
Who is it now?

542
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,119
Emilio.

543
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,119
Yes, tell me.

544
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,119
What is that?

545
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,119
What is it?

546
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,119
The scandal that is down there.

547
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,119
Those are the girls, Mr. Juan, who have set an alarm.

548
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,119
Come on, go up and see what happens.

549
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,119
Yes, yes, now I'm going, Mr. Juan, yes, now I'm going.

550
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,119
You go up with the girls.

551
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,119
I'm going to the bathroom.

552
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,119
I'm going to the bathroom.

553
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,119
I'm going to the bathroom.

554
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,119
I'm going to the bathroom.

555
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,199
You go up with your sister, the one from Alcalá de Nares,

556
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,199
you asshole.

557
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:48,199
Call me at 2 in the morning, it's going to be...

558
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,199
It's going to be abnormal, man.

559
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:54,199
The paper, take the paper, take the paper.

560
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,199
Fuck, but what happened?

561
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,199
It's an alarm.

562
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,199
I'm going to see what happens.

563
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,199
No, no, don't go.

564
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,199
Don't worry, nothing is going to happen to me.

565
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:03,199
You go to sleep.

566
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,199
But if I can't.

567
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,199
Put the code in, please.

568
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:10,199
I've already put it in, but I don't know where I've touched.

569
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,279
I'll ask for help.

570
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,279
No, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.

571
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,279
They're sleeping.

572
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,279
But how are they going to sleep?

573
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,279
They seem to be bombing us.

574
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,279
Are you all right?

575
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,279
Yes, I don't know what he's done with the alarm.

576
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,279
Come on, come on, son, do you want to drink something?

577
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,279
Let's see, tell me the code.

578
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,279
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

579
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,279
It's a secret, we can't tell anyone.

580
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,279
Ma'am, I'm your neighbor.

581
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,279
Vicenta, for my time, tell us.

582
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,279
But what happened?

583
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,279
Who came in?

584
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,279
This one.

585
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,279
I came to help.

586
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,279
So you set up an alarm and you don't tell me?

587
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,359
What was missing?

588
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
Why don't you disconnect it?

589
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,359
Why don't you want to tell me the code?

590
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,359
Vicenta, tell us, then change it and that's it.

591
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,359
No, I know this code very well because it's my date of birth.

592
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,359
And how old are you?

593
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,359
65 years old, why?

594
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,359
Oh, how relieved.

595
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,359
How did you do it?

596
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,359
Well, come on, it's fine, let's all go to bed.

597
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,359
Good night.

598
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,359
Good night.

599
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,359
What security.

600
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,439
Security?

601
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,439
I don't know anyone.

602
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,439
Come on, let's go to bed.

603
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,439
Let's go to bed.

604
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,439
Let's see, is it clear?

605
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,439
Yes, yes, yes.

606
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,439
I touched my forehead like this.

607
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,439
I say my phrase.

608
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,439
But what is your phrase?

609
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,439
I got a lot of dirt in the building.

610
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,439
But what, sir, I've pissed you off as if you were upset.

611
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,439
No, it's just that it bothers me.

612
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,439
Well, let's go, let's go.

613
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,439
Come on.

614
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,439
I touch my forehead and what do you say?

615
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,439
I got a lot of dirt in the building.

616
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,439
Well, better, better, come on, let's keep rehearsing.

617
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,439
I touch my forehead and you say?

618
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,439
I got a lot of dirt in the building.

619
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,439
There, there, that's it.

620
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,519
Come on, sir, I put on a little teacup to the theater.

621
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,519
And why did you leave it?

622
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,519
Because my mother said this was from Maritita.

623
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,519
Listen to me, don't keep painting, please.

624
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,519
This color doesn't like my girlfriend.

625
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,519
This color is horrible.

626
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,519
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

627
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,519
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but keep painting.

628
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,519
In addition, you are destroying the park,

629
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,519
put a little plastic, come on.

630
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,519
Hello.

631
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,519
Man, Juan Cuesta, president of the community.

632
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,519
Indeed, I have to tell you that we have detected certain irregularities in this way

633
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,599
and the wish of the entire community is that the works end immediately.

634
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,599
I agree.

635
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,599
Now you tell them, please.

636
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,599
You are causing many problems.

637
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,599
And I get very dirty in the difficult.

638
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,599
You're right, Emilio.

639
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,599
But hey, are you here again?

640
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,599
What do you want?

641
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,599
Don't let me in.

642
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,599
I was telling your boyfriend that you have thrown a load wall.

643
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,599
A load wall, a load wall, what does it say?

644
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,599
And for that you need a project and the signature of an architect.

645
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,599
Well, Roberto is an architect.

646
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,599
Eh?

647
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,599
Ah, no, eh, well, well, well, well,

648
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:31,679
to what I was going to ...

649
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,679
And I got very dirty in the building.

650
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,679
Oh, come on, what's up with the building editors?

651
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,679
They're going to clean it up when they're done.

652
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
Oh, and you're also going to change the windows.

653
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,679
Well, if we're going to change the windows, what happens?

654
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
Well, it's an alteration of common elements.

655
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,679
Any neighbor could be bothered by it and report you.

656
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,679
Are you threatening us?

657
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,679
No, no, no, no, no, no.

658
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:54,679
Better, because if not, I'm going to report the second B for the parabolic antenna,

659
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:56,679
the first B for the air conditioning

660
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,679
and the first A for hanging the pots off the balcony

661
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,759
and the community,

662
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,759
because the extinguishers have not passed the last five reviews

663
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,759
and that elevator has not a single security measure.

664
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,759
Well, I don't think it's going to be like that either.

665
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,759
Now that we're talking about it ...

666
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,759
And the building is very dirty.

667
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,759
You want to shut up already, Emilio?

668
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,759
Well, I have a document for the front.

669
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,759
And this man is living in a common area

670
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,759
that according to the plans of the building is a garbage room.

671
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,759
That I live in a garbage room?

672
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,759
Come on, call the city hall, do an inspection

673
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,759
and tomorrow this man is in the street.

674
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,759
Mr. Juan, they want to throw me out.

675
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,839
Hey, honey, I don't think that's for ...

676
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,839
No, no, no, no.

677
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,839
If we're going to talk things, we're going to talk things.

678
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,839
Okay.

679
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,839
In view of your attitude, I have no choice

680
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,839
but to call an extraordinary neighborhood meeting.

681
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,839
Very well.

682
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,839
Goodbye. Goodbye.

683
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,839
Hey, don't throw me away, please.

684
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,839
It will be a garbage room, but I have taken care of it, damn it.

685
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,839
Emilio!

686
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,839
Coming, coming.

687
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,839
A little bit of human warmth, huh?

688
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,839
Nasty.

689
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,839
Well, why do you let them paint the wall in that color?

690
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,839
What did I say?

691
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,839
There it is.

692
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,839
But what happened? What happened?

693
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,839
What happened?

694
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,839
That a new neighbor is going to be set up,

695
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,839
they are going to report us to everyone.

696
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,839
And to us, why?

697
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,839
To you two for the geraniums that you have hung on the balcony.

698
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,839
See, I told you not to take them from the park.

699
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,839
If no one saw me?

700
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,839
No, no, if you have hung them outside

701
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,839
and that is prohibited, why does that fall?

702
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,919
A pot or whatever falls on the head and it opens.

703
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,919
But if you can't see inside.

704
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,919
And this one, the parabolic, they are going to take it away.

705
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:33,919
See?

706
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,919
I already told you that to put it you had to ask for permission.

707
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,919
But they want to throw me out of the goal

708
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,919
because they say this is a garbage room.

709
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,919
But that doesn't matter to anyone.

710
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:41,919
And to you two, the air.

711
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,919
What?

712
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:43,919
Yes, yes, the air is air-conditioned.

713
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,919
You have it under the window

714
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,919
and that is terminally prohibited.

715
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,919
Let's see, who wants to take it away from us?

716
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:49,919
The new neighbors.

717
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,919
Well, let them buy one.

718
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:51,919
But let's see, what have we done

719
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,919
so that they want to report us to everyone?

720
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The president of the community

721
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
who has put himself on the edge

722
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and wants to stop the work.

723
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And then she has rebounded

724
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and these pijas when they rebound,

725
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
apparently they are.

726
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well, I don't take my generals away.

727
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
If I have to go to jail, I go to jail.

728
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And I with you.

729
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Well, but that's not all.

730
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They say that the building is in ruins,

731
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that they are going to call an inspector

732
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and that they are going to be paying for branches

733
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
until Spain wins again Eurovision festival.

734
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
How do you see it?

735
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Hey, you lawyer, can that happen?

736
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Winning Eurovision?

737
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's complicated.

738
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
No, man, no.

739
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
They report us and we have to keep paying for branches of those.

740
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,079
Well, yes, the truth is,

741
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,079
as they are talking seriously,

742
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,079
they can get us in trouble.

743
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,079
Good afternoon.

744
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,079
Good afternoon.

745
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,079
Alicia, do you want to explain what I do here?

746
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,079
You make the fool alone.

747
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,159
Hello.

748
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,159
The shirt I've thrown is yours.

749
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,159
Oh.

750
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,159
Hello.

751
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,159
Hello.

752
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,159
Sorry, we were having the clothes

753
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,159
and Belén has dropped a shirt on your accord.

754
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,159
Yes, I dropped it.

755
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,159
This one, right?

756
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,159
Yes, just.

757
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,159
As I don't know who it is, I'm going to lower it to the goalkeeper.

758
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:11,159
No, not to the goalkeeper, that it stays.

759
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,159
Well, well.

760
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,159
Well nothing.

761
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,159
One day we could stay four and have a drink.

762
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,159
Yes, yes, come whenever you want.

763
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:26,159
Tonight?

764
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,159
Tonight.

765
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:28,159
Tomorrow?

766
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,159
I don't know if ...

767
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,159
Are you coming at 10?

768
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,159
At 10, yes.

769
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:32,159
In your house.

770
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,159
No, better here, no.

771
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,159
Well, no.

772
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,159
Tell your friend, huh?

773
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,159
To Mauri.

774
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:38,159
Yes, yes, I'll tell him.

775
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,159
Come on, he's going to be delighted.

776
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,159
What?

777
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,159
But why did you stay with them?

778
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:45,159
But what did you want me to do?

779
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,159
I couldn't think of any excuse.

780
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,159
Well, there are very good ones.

781
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,159
That you are gay, that you have a boyfriend,

782
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,159
a stable relationship.

783
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
But if nothing happens, we stay with her,

784
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
we chat for a while, we have a drink and so friendly ...

785
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
No, no, no, no, no, with me you count.

786
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
I have nothing else to do at this point than to go straight for life.

787
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
No, no.

788
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
But what happens, that I can't have friends or what?

789
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Yes, if they are lesbians.

790
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
What are you laughing at?

791
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Let's see, no, what are you laughing at?

792
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
It's that it seems so absurd that it makes me laugh.

793
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Oh yeah?

794
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
You know what happens to you?

795
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
That you like that.

796
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Don't say that, Mauri.

797
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Yes, and you want to check what it feels like

798
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
when one is sleeping with a woman.

799
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
I already slept with a woman.

800
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Don't remind me.

801
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Please, it's not necessary.

802
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
You know what I'm telling you?

803
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,319
I have to take care of the rabbit.

804
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,319
If you want to throw five years of relationship by the edge,

805
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,319
you throw them, what happens?

806
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,319
You.

807
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,319
We take three.

808
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,319
Do you have anything else?

809
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,319
They have made me very long.

810
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,319
You know what Fernando?

811
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,319
I'm leaving.

812
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,319
Where?

813
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,319
I have no idea, but I'm leaving.

814
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,319
Well, it's me.

815
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,319
Mauri.

816
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:43,319
Uy, uy, uy, uy, uy, uy, uy, uy, uy, uy, uy.

817
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,319
Honey.

818
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,399
Honey.

819
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,399
Are you really going to give up on me?

820
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,399
Of course not.

821
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:52,399
Why?

822
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:54,399
Because we are not going to get out of here alive.

823
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,399
Calm down, I just wanted to put fear in your body.

824
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,399
Yeah, but you've put it in me.

825
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,399
You should have run your voice

826
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,399
because on the portal

827
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,399
they have dedicated me a few affectionate looks.

828
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,399
Yeah, and what did you want me to do?

829
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,399
It's that guy down there who makes me sick.

830
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,399
Well, I don't know, but at least consult me.

831
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
Maybe I don't feel like living in front of all the neighbors.

832
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,399
I have enough with the works.

833
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,399
Okay.

834
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,399
I feel a little tense.

835
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,399
Tense?

836
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,399
No, I haven't cut my veins

837
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,399
because I can't find the knife with the cause.

838
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:29,399
I also want to relax a little.

839
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,399
Don't get angry.

840
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Don't get angry.

841
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Let's see, ma'am.

842
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
I can't come and disconnect the alarm every time it jumps.

843
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Man, please, I have the children sleeping.

844
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Between this and the works, no one stops here.

845
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
We haven't been there this time.

846
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
We were in the bedroom, right?

847
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
I don't even know where I am.

848
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
I have a horrible dream.

849
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,559
So who was it?

850
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,559
Vicenta, if you let the dog loose, the alarm jumps.

851
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,559
And why?

852
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,559
If Valentino is a thief.

853
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,559
No, but he moves.

854
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,559
And that's a motion sensor.

855
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,559
Can't you see how it's not a camera?

856
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,559
And every time you pass in front of it, you greet it.

857
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,559
Hey, Juan, this can't go on like this.

858
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,559
Let's see.

859
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,559
If you don't know how to use the alarm, don't connect it.

860
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,559
What do you mean no?

861
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,559
What if they don't come in?

862
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,559
Nobody has entered since 68.

863
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,559
Well, come on, come on, everyone to sleep.

864
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,559
But my son, I'm not going to sleep.

865
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,639
But look, he's connecting it again.

866
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:34,639
Of course.

867
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:35,639
We're going to bed.

868
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,639
Come on, everyone, out, we have 10 seconds.

869
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:38,639
You come, take the dog.

870
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:39,639
Come on, Valentin.

871
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:40,639
Valentin.

872
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,639
Ladies, for God's sake, that alarm.

873
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:50,639
We have to wake them up.

874
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:51,639
Oh, what a...

875
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:02,639
Hello.

876
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:03,639
We're here.

877
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:04,639
Sorry for the delay.

878
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,639
It's just that Tasco caught us.

879
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:09,639
Come in.

880
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,639
What do you have in this bottle of whiskey?

881
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:16,639
Oh, very good, thank you very much.

882
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:17,639
I'll serve you others, okay?

883
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:18,639
I prefer wine.

884
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:19,639
Sit down.

885
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,639
What a nice house, huh?

886
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:23,639
Very nice.

887
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,639
With...

888
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,639
I would have gone up to the bike ride.

889
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:29,639
I would have gone up to the bike ride.

890
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Mauri has gone up to the neighbors' meeting.

891
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
He won't be able to come.

892
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Oh.

893
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
But well, nothing happens.

894
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
We drink something, the three of us.

895
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Yes, yes, nothing happens.

896
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
As soon as I get this feeling of humiliation,

897
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
I'm sure I'll have a great time.

898
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
You've realized, haven't you?

899
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Yes, pathetic.

900
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,720
It's that I don't care about those I don't like, Alicia.

901
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,720
No, Fernando told Mauri to go so that we can stay alone.

902
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Betty, Betty.

903
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
What do you mean, go?

904
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
But what do you want, to stay here, with those jetties?

905
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Well, as usual, as soon as you start giving the lot,

906
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I can watch TV.

907
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,799
No, Betty.

908
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,799
Thank you, we always do it like that.

909
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,799
I don't know what comes.

910
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,799
Thank you.

911
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,799
Thank you.

912
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,799
Thank you.

913
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,799
Well, the wine.

914
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,799
Yes.

915
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,799
And some chips or something.

916
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,799
Sure.

917
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,799
Are you all right?

918
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,799
Do you need something?

919
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,799
A ash-tree.

920
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,799
Oh, no, not that, because you can't smoke here.

921
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,799
Fuck, with Europe, you can't smoke

922
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,799
in the neighbors' meetings.

923
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,799
I'm sorry.

924
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:28,879
We'll start right away.

925
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,879
But take canapés, eat,

926
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:32,879
they're for eating, not to look at them.

927
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:33,879
They're great, huh?

928
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:34,879
Now I'm going back.

929
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:36,879
What canapés?

930
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:38,879
What do you mean, mortadela?

931
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:39,879
Well, it's delicious, huh?

932
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:41,879
She has put butter and everything.

933
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:42,879
It's a man.

934
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:43,879
I'm not hungry.

935
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,879
Well, what tension is there in the environment.

936
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,879
Well, let's see, I've already taken notes.

937
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:50,879
If an inspection comes and we have to fix

938
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,879
the elevator, the ladder, the paint, the cracks,

939
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,879
the extinguishers and change the boiler,

940
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
the boiler costs us about 18,000 euros.

941
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Three million pesos.

942
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Oh, well, isn't it that much between all of us?

943
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
No, three million pesos per floor.

944
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Oh, my God, what are you saying?

945
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
But how are we going to pay for that?

946
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
I prefer that the roof falls and kills us all.

947
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
It's the fault of that idiot

948
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
of a president that we have.

949
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
And what about you?

950
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Don't you say anything?

951
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Yes, I'm leaving.

952
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
But how are you going to get there?

953
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Where are you going?

954
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
You have to vote.

955
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
There's always a trap.

956
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

957
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,039
If you get there now, it's going to seem like you're jealous.

958
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,039
And you're not jealous, Mauri.

959
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,039
Do whatever you want.

960
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,039
It's also my house,

961
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,039
and I can go in and out whenever I want.

962
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,039
Look, it's not that it's too soon.

963
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,039
Look, I'm going to go down.

964
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,039
Besides, killing me, I'm getting home with less.

965
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,039
That lawyer sounds very nice, doesn't he?

966
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:48,039
At first you think you're going to fix the world.

967
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,039
The world is shit.

968
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,039
I don't have a job.

969
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,039
Neither does he.

970
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,119
I don't even talk to my parents.

971
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,119
Men are all immature.

972
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,119
Hey, Vanessa is going to have to go.

973
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,119
She's not feeling well, she told me before.

974
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,119
Well, well, well.

975
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,119
We'll meet another day.

976
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,119
No, but it's not that bad.

977
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,119
Stay a while, woman.

978
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,119
I'm here.

979
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,119
Now.

980
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,119
Forgive me for being late, but...

981
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,119
I've met my ex-girlfriend and she's given me a number.

982
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,119
What are you saying?

983
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,119
What you hear is that she's been nervous.

984
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:25,199
She's been trying to cut her veins with the transport hub.

985
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,199
Very unpleasant.

986
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,199
Weren't you at the meeting?

987
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,199
No, no, I wasn't.

988
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,199
We thought you weren't coming anymore.

989
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,199
Well, here I am.

990
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,199
Belén has stopped asking about you.

991
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,199
Well, I asked something.

992
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,199
Don't be shy, woman.

993
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:43,199
Well, I'm going to get a drink.

994
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,199
You want more ice, right?

995
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,199
I do.

996
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,279
I'm going to put ice on me.

997
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:50,279
We're all nervous.

998
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:52,279
Since when do you like whiskey?

999
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,279
Since you like women.

1000
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,279
You'll see, you'll see how well we're going to have it.

1001
00:35:58,279 --> 00:35:59,279
Have they all arrived?

1002
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:00,279
They're missing the new ones.

1003
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,279
They're scared.

1004
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,279
Have you seen that all the neighbors support me and they've backed out?

1005
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,279
I didn't want to get into this situation.

1006
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,279
Paloma, you know what?

1007
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:08,279
Yes.

1008
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,279
They've forgotten me.

1009
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,279
Yes, honey.

1010
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,279
Come on, come on.

1011
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,279
To triumph.

1012
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:16,279
Courage.

1013
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Courage.

1014
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Oh, my president.

1015
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
What a great bet.

1016
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Good afternoon, welcome everyone.

1017
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
We're going to start the extraordinary meeting.

1018
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
The new ones are missing.

1019
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Well, but we're enough owners for the vote to be valid.

1020
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
So let's get started.

1021
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Turn off your mobile phone and don't smoke.

1022
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
To talk, raise your hand.

1023
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
And to insult, also raise it.

1024
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Day's order.

1025
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Point first.

1026
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Good evening.

1027
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Good evening.

1028
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Sorry for the delay.

1029
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Good evening.

1030
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Good evening.

1031
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
She was so cute.

1032
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Continue.

1033
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Point first.

1034
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Voting to exercise the action of ceasing and formally require the owner of the third A

1035
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,440
to stop the annoying and unhealthy and harmful activity that is developing in their home

1036
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,440
and that prevents the normal development of coexistence in this community.

1037
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,519
Well, we didn't come to talk about the works.

1038
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,519
Well, that's what she said.

1039
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,519
That we are going to vote everyone to stop the works.

1040
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,519
What bad does your husband explain?

1041
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,519
He makes a bet so that we don't understand him.

1042
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,519
We're starting.

1043
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,519
Dear neighbors, as you know,

1044
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,519
we have had some new neighbors who have decided to take a step forward to this community.

1045
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,519
Without warning anyone,

1046
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,519
they have started some reform works that bother us all

1047
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,519
and that put the security of the building in danger.

1048
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,519
That's a lie.

1049
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:41,519
Please, respect that the president is talking about.

1050
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,519
I'm not going to tell you in person.

1051
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,519
I tell you that if we vote in favor of the separation of the works,

1052
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,519
the works are separated.

1053
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,519
Or that, or we go to court.

1054
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,519
So let's vote.

1055
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,519
Emilio, I'm going to count the votes.

1056
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,519
Yes, Mr. President.

1057
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,519
Votes in favor of the separation of the work.

1058
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,519
One.

1059
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,519
Well, let's see, I don't think you've understood me well.

1060
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,519
I said those who are in favor,

1061
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,519
in favor,

1062
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,519
of the separation of the works,

1063
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,519
raise your hand.

1064
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,519
One, one.

1065
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,519
I see it.

1066
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,519
Well, you've all complained, no one is going to raise their hand.

1067
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,519
Man, Vicenta, thank you.

1068
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,519
Two votes in favor.

1069
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,519
No, no, where is the bathroom?

1070
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,519
The bathroom is there, to the right.

1071
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,519
It's possible, you're in a hurry.

1072
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,519
Thank you.

1073
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,519
Well, let's see, votes against.

1074
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,519
I have two votes, I remember.

1075
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,519
One, two, three, all.

1076
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,519
Well, I don't understand anything.

1077
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,519
Can you know what's going on here?

1078
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,519
Poor things, they don't bother so much either.

1079
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,519
I'm not used to the noise.

1080
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,519
I'm not, but in the parabolic no one touches it.

1081
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,519
So you sold yourself, you gave in to blackmail and threaten that woman.

1082
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,519
What a shame, it's outrageous.

1083
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,519
What is outrageous is that our works are so important to her.

1084
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:03,519
When I find it much more serious the state of the building or the poor management of the community.

1085
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,519
Yes, that's very good, but it sounds like demagogy, because it doesn't appear in the order of the day.

1086
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,519
The girl is right, the stairs are so easy, the other day I almost killed myself.

1087
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,519
And the phone is killing me.

1088
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,519
They told us that in the electrical installation we had to change it.

1089
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,519
If the day was less thought out, the building would have burned down and we would all die carbonized.

1090
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,519
If they are going to have to identify us by the teeth.

1091
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,519
This one doesn't have.

1092
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,519
Well, let's see, we've already talked about that and it's true that we have to do things, but now there is no money.

1093
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,519
Where is it?

1094
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,519
In the new car that they have bought.

1095
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,519
But hey, lady.

1096
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,519
One moment, are you doubting my honesty?

1097
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,519
I think so.

1098
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,519
You are doubting, you are doubting.

1099
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,599
Do you think that a manager is going to be in charge, like everyone else?

1100
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,599
Maybe you're not doing the maths right.

1101
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,599
Chorizo!

1102
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,599
In 12 years that I have been president, I had never heard anything like it.

1103
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,599
12 years.

1104
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,599
12 years.

1105
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,599
But the president is elected every year.

1106
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,599
My husband is the only one who introduces himself every year as a volunteer.

1107
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,599
Well, I offer myself as a volunteer.

1108
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,599
Maybe what the community needs is a change.

1109
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,599
I'm not going to resign.

1110
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:07,599
I sincerely believe that my work has been ...

1111
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,599
Go ahead, Mr. Cuesta, go ahead.

1112
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:13,519
But how are we going to vote for this girl if we don't know her at all?

1113
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,519
Well, she can fix herself on the stairs, I vote for you.

1114
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,519
Well, me too, provided I leave my parabolic where it is.

1115
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,519
No, but what you have to do is put one for all in the attic, which is cheaper.

1116
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,519
And I call the company and my father paints the building for us for half the price.

1117
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:32,519
Order, order, the assembly is suspended.

1118
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,519
Why don't we start voting for the girl?

1119
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,519
Because the order of the day is not figured out, now.

1120
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,519
Order, order, the assembly is suspended.

1121
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,519
There are no requests and no questions.

1122
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,519
There are no requests and no questions.

1123
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,519
Everyone, go away.

1124
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,519
You're done with the chorizo.

1125
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:50,519
You're done with the chorizo.

1126
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,519
Don't worry about anything, Juan, you don't worry about anything.

1127
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,519
Well, has it been good, Mr. President?

1128
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:02,519
Here there is no one alive, here there is no one alive, no.

1129
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,519
The problem with Fernando with women is that he is very shy, you know, very insecure.

1130
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,519
He doesn't know what he wants, right?

1131
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,519
Can we stop talking about me, please?

1132
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,519
No, I feel the same way, but it's because I haven't found the man of my life yet.

1133
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:17,519
Look, he's looking for him, huh?

1134
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,519
He does it every day.

1135
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,519
No, but Fernando doesn't give him any eggs.

1136
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,519
I mean, he hears the word commitment and runs away.

1137
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:28,519
And the man, I'm afraid he's going to end up very lonely.

1138
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,519
Are you with someone now?

1139
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,519
There is something.

1140
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,519
Yes, there is something.

1141
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,519
What we don't know is what it's going to last.

1142
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:36,519
Yes, because he's starting to make me feel a little uncomfortable.

1143
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,519
Oh, those are the worst.

1144
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,519
They always leave Belén for that.

1145
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,519
I'm going to put on a glass, if I have my hands busy.

1146
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,519
Fernando, if you feel uncomfortable, it's best you leave it.

1147
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,519
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1148
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:49,519
Sorry, that's not so easy to leave, hey, let her go, let her go.

1149
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:52,519
No, she's a great girl, no.

1150
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,519
You tell me what you want, nothing more.

1151
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,519
Yes, but Mauri, I don't think she's interested in my personal life.

1152
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:01,519
Oh yes, yes, we are interested, of course.

1153
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,519
Well, at this point, I have no choice but to tell you ...

1154
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,519
that we have run out of ice.

1155
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,519
We have at home.

1156
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:14,519
Is it because of the ice?

1157
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:17,519
The thing is, it's a little late, I have to go to work tomorrow.

1158
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:19,519
I'm going to work, I'm going to work.

1159
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,519
If you have ice, just start.

1160
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,519
Come on, come on, if you just start ...

1161
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,519
Well.

1162
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,519
That music.

1163
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,519
What?

1164
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,519
It's my house.

1165
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,519
Let's go up the elevator.

1166
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,519
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1167
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,519
Why are we going up through the ice?

1168
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,519
We asked these girls, they have everything.

1169
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,519
No, man, it's past 12.

1170
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,519
But who will be at this hour?

1171
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,519
Be careful with the tear.

1172
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:50,519
Come on, come on, come on.

1173
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,519
See? I dial the numbers and see if it stops.

1174
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:00,519
That man has written it wrong.

1175
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,519
Leave me alone.

1176
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,519
Now, to bed.

1177
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,519
You'll see how I broke it.

1178
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:19,519
It seems to be taking too long.

1179
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,519
Well, yes.

1180
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,519
You don't know one thing.

1181
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,519
Look, look, Alicia.

1182
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:33,519
I had a great time, you seem like a great girl.

1183
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,519
But I don't want anything now.

1184
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,519
I'm going through a bit of a personal stage.

1185
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,519
Complicated.

1186
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,519
I think it would be best if we were just friends.

1187
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,519
No, I was going to tell you that I'm going out in this magazine.

1188
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:45,519
Announcing that I'm going to be a friend.

1189
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,519
Announcing Muesli bars.

1190
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:51,519
Those energy bars?

1191
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:53,519
Yes.

1192
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:56,519
They are very rich.

1193
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:58,519
I don't like them.

1194
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,519
Hey, I'm going to go upstairs.

1195
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:02,519
You want to go to bed.

1196
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:03,519
Yes.

1197
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,519
Well, that ...

1198
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,519
Nothing, I've had a great time.

1199
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,519
That when you want, we can see each other again.

1200
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,519
Yeah, you told me before.

1201
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,519
Well.

1202
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,519
Surprise.

1203
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,519
We bring a bottle of tequila and the best of George and Dan.

1204
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,519
I'm sorry, I haven't had time to hide it.

1205
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,519
The little chiringuito.

1206
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:26,519
Well, I'm going to sleep.

1207
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,519
Don't make too much noise, please.

1208
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:30,519
Well, I'm leaving too, I'm very tired.

1209
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:32,519
But what is this? The Muervo route?

1210
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:34,519
It's the first time he's going to sleep before me.

1211
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:36,519
But we have to celebrate it.

1212
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:38,519
And so much.

1213
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:40,519
The little chiringuito.

1214
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,519
No, but we ask for it in the drawer.

1215
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:44,519
No, Mauri, Mauri.

1216
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,519
What's wrong with dad?

1217
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,519
Nothing, honey, he's disgusted.

1218
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,519
He's had a bad day.

1219
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:52,519
Why don't we finish him off so he doesn't keep suffering?

1220
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:54,519
Don't say nonsense. Come on, to bed.

1221
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:56,519
Hala, go back to bed.

1222
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,519
Come on, both of you.

1223
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:04,519
Juan.

1224
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,519
Do you need something?

1225
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:08,519
I've done the ridiculous.

1226
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,519
Come on, let's go to bed.

1227
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:12,519
They've lost respect for me, Paloma.

1228
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:14,519
What? No.

1229
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:16,519
If here, except for your children, everyone respects you a lot.

1230
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,519
I like to be president.

1231
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,519
But you're going to keep being.

1232
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:22,519
Yes, how?

1233
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,519
Well, I'll take care of it, don't worry.

1234
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,519
Well, what are you going to do?

1235
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,519
Well, you don't know what I'm capable of doing for love.

1236
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,519
You love me, right, Paloma?

1237
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,519
Of course I love you, you're the man of my life.

1238
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,519
And I adore you and I wish you.

1239
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,519
And you don't know the things I've thought about to keep being president.

1240
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:38,519
I'm going to bed.

1241
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:42,519
Well, I liked that alarm.

1242
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,519
I felt safe.

1243
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:46,519
Well, from now on, if you want to feel safe,

1244
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,519
you put a compress with wings.

1245
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,519
What if the thieves come in?

1246
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,519
Well, let them kill us, but in silence.

1247
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,519
Hey, I was reading.

1248
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,519
Can I come in?

1249
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:00,519
Oh, no, I was reading this, you know.

1250
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,519
Belén, I'm caught.

1251
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,519
I'm caught.

1252
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,519
Look, tomorrow we go out there,

1253
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:08,519
you call another kid and that's it, you forget.

1254
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,519
Easy.

1255
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:12,519
At the same time, I shouldn't have kissed him.

1256
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,519
You kissed him?

1257
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,519
And, and has he answered you?

1258
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:18,519
Not yet.

1259
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,519
Oh, girl.

1260
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,519
I think it's a matter of giving him time.

1261
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,519
Yes, I think so, it's going to be time, that's what...

1262
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,519
Yes, it's going to be that, huh.

1263
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:28,519
Well, come on, see you tomorrow, huh.

1264
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,519
What a smile you have.

1265
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,519
It's cuter.

1266
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:34,519
How cute you are.

1267
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:36,519
Yes.

1268
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,519
You like yourself, huh.

1269
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,519
Yes.

1270
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:42,519
Hey, how about at the meeting? What happened?

1271
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,519
What happened?

1272
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,519
That they wanted to make me president.

1273
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,519
Of course, as you can see, I have coconut.

1274
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,519
And what did you tell them?

1275
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,519
What am I going to tell them?

1276
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,519
If you don't pay a cent.

1277
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,519
Hey, what am I going to tell you?

1278
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:58,519
I don't know.

1279
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:00,519
Well, I don't know, let's watch a movie.

1280
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,519
First you have to be a partner, I'm closing, Emilio.

1281
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,519
But what kind of video club is this?

1282
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:06,519
All the empty boxes are empty, this is a mess.

1283
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,519
I have the tapes there, so they don't steal them.

1284
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:21,940
This is a cover to sell the

1285
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1286
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1287
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1288
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1289
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1290
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1291
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1292
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1293
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1294
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1295
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1296
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1297
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1298
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,940
I don't know, I don't know.
